# 🎡 Travel App 🎡

## 🌍 About the project

By far my biggest project so far.

**Travel App** is a full-stack application that allows users to create, edit and delete travel posts, explore locations on an interactive map and discover details about places they’ve visited.

The app is built with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js / Express** on the backend.  
All posts are stored in **DataStax Astra DB (Document API)** and locations are visualized using **Mapbox**.

I’m genuinely proud of this project — it pushed me through many real-world frontend and backend challenges and helped me understand how full-stack applications actually work.

### ➕ Add a new adventure
You can add your own travel experience in two different ways — both open a modal where you can fill in all essential data.

### 📍 Post details
Clicking on a specific card opens a detailed view where you can:
- see the exact location on the map,
- visit the official website,
- edit or delete the post.
