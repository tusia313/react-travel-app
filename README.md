#   🎡 Travel app 🎡

## 🎠 What's it about?

By far, my biggest project. A travel app that allows users to add, edit, and delete posts and utilize the Google Maps API. It's a full-stack application, with React as a frontend and Node.js as backend. I am absolutely proud of it!

## 🎠 First look 
Here's a front page

where You can add Your own adventure in two ways, but every leads You to the modal, that You can fill with essential data.

By clicking in particular card, You have access to see more - like exact localization, website and ability to delete or edit a post. :)
